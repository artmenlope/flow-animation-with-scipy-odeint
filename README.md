# flow-animation-with-scipy-odeint

This script has been created just for fun. It creates an animation of a flow of particles (or points) whose trajectory has been calculated using the odeint function from the scipy.integrate sub-package.

The following animation can be obtained using the default acceleration field definition from the [script](https://github.com/artmenlope/flow-animation-with-scipy-odeint/blob/master/odeint-2d-flow.py).
